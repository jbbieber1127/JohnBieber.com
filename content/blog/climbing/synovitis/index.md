## Thanks

Before I get into the details, I want to thank others for sharing their own experiences with synovitis. The climbing community is really great at limit testing finger injuries. In my own case, the knowledge that the community provided was really helpful for making informed decisions for management and recovery. I don't know how useful my experience will be, but at the very least I hope someone can relate to it. 

The more I climb, the more I value injury prevention. The usual advice that is given to new climbers is "just climb", but when you get addicted to the sport it's still easy to take this too far.

## Summary of my synovitis

Swelling at the PIP joint in the Middle Finger on my Left Hand (MFLH for short). 

I didn't know about synovitis until this past year. In January of 2024, I started a Lattice training program. At the time, I recall having experienced joint soreness for about a month or two. Now, in February of 2025, the pain and swelling has increased to the point where it's interfering with my climbing. I avoid hard crimps, pockets, and any slopers where I might slip off, as this triggers my finger to swell up. It was tolerable until early December, but I think being forced inside by the cold and wet New England weather has pushed it over the edge. 

## How did I get here?

Synovitis is an overuse injury. One could reasonably conclude that I have been overusing that finger somehow. I have been asking myself why, if I am overdoing it, is _only_ my _MFLH_ affected by synovitis?

- Firstly, from June to July I dealt with A2 pulley soreness on my right middle finger. So, giving myself some credit, I am perfectly capable of overusing the fingers of my right hand as well.
- That said, since my _MFLH_ has become sore, some time at the end of 2023, it has never fully been pain-free. So in terms of overuse, my _MFLH_ seems to take more abuse.

### What I think are some contributing factors: {#Contributing-Factors}
  
  1. The last time I took rest from climbing was in September of 2023. I was out for the obligatory 10 days with COVID. Since then, the most I've rested between climbing days was 2 days. And that was maybe one time. My typical climbing schedule is 4 days a week: Tuesday night (bouldering), Thursday night (bouldering), Saturday (bouldering), Sunday (Lead climbing). Every other week, I had one day of non-climbing between climbing days. The most restful week I had was in July, when I climbed 5 days in a week, but 3 of those days were easy climbing (~5.8 Lead/TR).
  2. My _typical_ schedule is written above, but some of those days involved leading at Farley, then hitting the gym for a bouldering session. Or bouldering outside somewhere, then hitting the gym for... more bouldering. Or bouldering in the gym, then lead climbing because I still had energy and it's fun as hell. You get the picture.

  I put these two first because I think it's relatively obvious in hindsight, or perhaps foresight, that I don't take enough rest (I _am_ writing this post about an overuse injury). Not to beat a dead horse, but lack of rest is, in my opinion, the foremost cause of my injury. However, I don't regret it at all. Climbing is super fun, and I wish I could do it _all_ day _every_ day. That said, going forward I am hoping that my habit adjustments will prevent more injuries.

  3. In the fall, I was working on this sport climb at Farley called [_Octopus Balls_ (5.12a)](https://youtu.be/IWr1DV70O24?t=255). It's pretty chill climbing except for this one move which is absolutely brutal. I had put the climb aside for a while, but someone gave me beta >!right before the crux where you can get a double-kneebar rest!<. I worked the climb some more, and eventually figured out that I could >!static the crux move by wiggling my index and!< MFLH into a pocket, then cranking down on those super hard to pull through to the next crimps. I used this beta one week and distinctly remember saying "I can't do that more than once" because it pissed off my knuckle. I came back the next week and sent the climb, but I was aware it might have tweaked my finger more. I don't think this would have been a problem on its own, but combined with the already-inflamed knuckle, it made the problem worse.
  - Of course there have been other specific climbs that have made the knuckle worse, each one adding slightly more recovery debt.

  So again, _why_ my left hand?

  4. I believe the next root cause is muscle imbalance. Visually, my right arm muscles are about 10-15% larger than my left. When climbing, I am much more capable doing any strenuous moves with my right arm. If I have to crimp on my left arm, I wind up chicken-winging a lot more often than I would on my right. Further, when I execute moves that require favoring my left hand, I tend to snatch for the next hold with my right hand more often. If you mirrored the same holds, I could lock off on my right arm and comfortably reach to the next hold. I asked my PT to evaluate my left arm "up the chain," and she reported that my shoulder was much stiffer on the left side.
